# Version 1.3.0 Update 🚀


We've been hard at work making **Attendly** more intuitive and reliable. Here is what has changed in this version:


---


### 🔧 Fix 
#### Daily Page
* **Duplicated Category `Open`**: Not possible to update to `Category.open` from another Category entry.

#### Directory Page
* **Fields category and migration are updated**

* **Comment fields now have the ok button on Keyboard**

* **Date is displayed as `dd.MM.yyyy` format**

* **Removed Id's from person entries**: To not confuse why the coutting is out of order


### 🆕 New Features
#### Daily Page
* **Search through daily log**: Now with a new icon (on the bottom right) you are able to search for people / description or both also by category and find results.
Tap on a result to be navigated to the back to the daily page and see the result from there.

* **Changelog**: You're looking at it! We added a markdown-based system to keep you informed of updates.
